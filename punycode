The From address contains only ASCII localpart, and a punycode-encoded
domain. This is similar to what e.g. Exchange and Mutt generate.

The To address contains UTF8 in the localpart and again an encoded domain.
This is also similar to what Exchange and Mutt generate.

Parsers and readers should handle both forms in the same way.
